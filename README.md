OCDS Indonesia
==============

A data repository for Indonesia procurement data using [OCDS specification](http://ocds.open-contracting.org/standard/r/0__3__3/).

The mapping technique is based on [open-contracting/mapper](https://github.com/open-contracting/mapper) project developed by Sarah Bird. Please find the detail instructions [here](http://standard.open-contracting.org/field-notes-transforming-canadian-procurement-data-to-ocds-format/).

Below is the example for running the mapping script:
```
$ cd oc-mapper
$ python mapper.py --csv-file ../lpse-procurement-2013.csv --mapping-file ../mapping-lpse-procurement.json > ../lpse-procurement-2013.json
```
